## A HTML-based Leaflet Library

### Introduction

Hyperleaflet is a library that allows you to use the popular Leaflet library with just HTML attributes.

### How does it work?

Hyperleaflet uses HTML dataset attributes as inputs. For example:
```html

    <div id="map" class="map" data-center="[39.73, 39.99]" data-zoom="5">
        <div data-tile="EsriWorldImagery" data-max-zoom="19" data-min-zoom="5" data-default></div>
        <div data-tile="OpenStreetMap"></div>
    </div>
```

### Showing Data
Hyperleaflet listens to HTML elements marked with data-hyperleaflet-source":
```html
    <table data-hyperleaflet-source >
        <tr data-id="1" data-geometry="[32.85,39.97]" data-geometry-type="Point">
            <td>39.97</td>
            <td>32.85</td>
            <td>Ankara</td>
        </tr>
        ...
    </table>
```
Every HTML element tagged with data-id and data-geometry will be added to the Leaflet map as a point marker. This allows you to easily display data on the map.

Hyperleaflet will also listen for changes in HTML and dynamically update the Leaflet map accordingly.


### What is cooking?

Hyperleaflet will be constantly evolving. 
We're working on adding new features and functionality.


 We're working towards version 1.0 and will be publishing a roadmap to outline our plans. However, we're not afraid to experiment and try new things on the way. We welcome feedback and suggestions from the all map loving communities.
